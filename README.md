# Flight_Price_Prediction ðŸ›«

## Goal
The task of predicting flight fares is a classical time-series forecasting problem that has been tackled by several popular flight booking platforms, including Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Hopper, through the use of machine learning algorithms. This project endeavors to **develop a robust ML model that can accurately predict the cost of flight tickets**.
